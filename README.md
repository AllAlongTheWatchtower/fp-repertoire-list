# fp-repertoire-list
Final Project for Tianshu Chu, Valerie Hurwitz, Kay Rittichier, and Yibo Xiao

This project assists musicians trying to track and organize repertoire lists of pieces they have learned.
The program uses data from The Echo Nest (http://the.echonest.com/) to bring up lists of pieces of a given composer.
The user can select pieces and add them to a repertoire list, which is displyed in a separate tab.

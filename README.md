# fp-repertoire-list
Final Project for CS222

This project assists musicians trying to track and organize repertoire lists of pieces they have learned.
The program uses data from The Echo Nest (http://the.echonest.com/) to bring up lists of pieces of a given composer.
The user can select pieces and add them to a repertoire list, which is displayed in a separate tab.

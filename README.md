# fp-repertoire-list
Final Project for CS222
Valerie Hurwitz and Kay Rittichier

INTRODUCTION
This project assists musicians trying to track and organize repertoire lists of pieces they have learned.
The program uses data from The Echo Nest (http://the.echonest.com/) to bring up lists of pieces of a given composer.
The user can select pieces and add them to a repertoire list, which is displayed in a separate tab.

The Echo Nest requires an api key, which is specific to the user.  You will need to apply for an api key
if you wish to use the program.
